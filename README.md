## [The Wicci System](https://github.com/GregDavidson/wicci-core-S0_lib)

The Wicci System is a collaborative content management system.  It consists of twelve extensive components which have each been given their own git repository to allow them to be reused more flexibly.  All components should be checked out and linked together appropriately before trying to build the Wicci System.  The [WicciCore]((https://github.com/GregDavidson/wicci-core-S0_lib) repository contains the top-level structure and an overview of the other components and their repositories.
